This study introduces the **first comprehensive framework** for evaluating LLMs’ ability to generate and reuse slang.  
We quantify **linguistic creativity** through morphological complexity, semantic novelty, and coherence—bridging computational sociolinguistics and model evaluation to reveal how LLMs internalize informal and cultural language.
