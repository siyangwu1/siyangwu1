We develop a **self-hypothesis generation algorithm** where LLMs compare peer-reviewed papers to infer tacit evaluative heuristics behind human judgments.  
The results reveal shared explicit priors but divergent *implicit posteriors*, showing that storytelling and contextual framing deeply influence human and model evaluation alike.
