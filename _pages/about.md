Hello everyone, and welcome to my personal bio!  

I completed my undergraduate studies at the **University of Michigan**, where I earned my **B.S. in Data Science** (Go Blue!).  
Currently, I am pursuing a **Master of Science in Data Science** at the **University of Chicago**, under the **Data Science Institute (DSI)**.  

During my time here, I have had the opportunity to work with incredible faculty and collaborators, including **Prof. James Evans** head of the Knowledge Lab, **Prof. Zhewei Sun** in the Speech and Language Group at the **Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)**, **Prof. Ari Holtzman** head of Conceptualization Lab, and **Prof. Bryon Aragam** at the Booth School of Business.  

### Research Interests

My research interests revolve around developing **principled frameworks to understand and evaluate large language models (LLMs)**—not just by their accuracy, but by what they *know*, *how* they reason, and *why* they fail. I aim to connect **behavioral reliability**, **semantic generalization**, and **social interpretation** in model evaluation.  

Broadly, my work focuses on:  
- **Credibility and Calibration:** Designing behavioral metrics that quantify the *credibility gap* between perturbed and unperturbed model states, bridging black-box reliability with internal reasoning stability.  
- **Benchmark Semantics and Meta-Evaluation:** Analyzing *benchmark overlap* and *perplexity signatures* to uncover what benchmarks truly measure and how model families internalize shared linguistic functions.  
- **Language and Society:** Using LLMs as scientific instruments to surface tacit human norms and evaluative heuristics—the “unwritten code” underlying peer review, storytelling, and cultural reasoning.  
- **Creative and Informal Language:** Investigating how models generate and reuse slang and informal expressions to assess their linguistic creativity, coherence, and informativeness.  

My broader goal is to advance **AI for Science (AI4Sci)** by building interpretable evaluation pipelines that link statistical robustness with scientific and social understanding.


### Open to Collaborations

I am always open to collaborations! If you have an interesting or early-stage idea—even a naïve one—let’s discuss it and see how we can turn it into something impactful together.
