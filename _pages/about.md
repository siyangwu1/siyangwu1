Hello everyone, and welcome to my personal bio!  

I completed my undergraduate studies at the **University of Michigan**, where I earned my **B.S. in Data Science** (Go Blue!).  
Currently, I am pursuing a **Master of Science in Data Science** at the **University of Chicago**, under the **Data Science Institute (DSI)**.  

During my time here, I have had the opportunity to work with incredible faculty and collaborators, including [**Prof. James Evans**](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/james-evans) at the [Knowledge Lab](https://knowledgelab.org/), [**Prof. Zhewei Sun**](https://zhewei-sun.github.io/) in the [Speech and Language Group](https://slattic.ttic.edu/) at the [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)](https://www.ttic.edu/), [**Prof. Ari Holtzman**](https://ariholtzman.com/) at the [Conceptualization Lab](https://conceptualization.ai/), and [**Prof. Bryon Aragam**](https://bryonaragam.com/) at the [Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/).
 

### Research Interests

My research focuses on understanding, designing, and deploying AI systems that support social goods and align with human values and capabilities. Where Wtih in I foucs on the following three asepcts:

**Cultural Co-Evolution of Machines and Humans**

I investigate how LLMs absorb and reproduce the latent structures of human imagination, scientific judgment, and cultural evolution.

**Automation of Scientific Discovery**

I design agentic frameworks and human-in-the-loop systems that enable LLMs to act as proactive "co-theorists" in scientific reasoning and hypothesis generation.

**Rethinking LLM Benchmarking Paradigms**

I develop principled methods to evaluate model capabilities and credibility beyond traditional benchmarks, probing the internal exposure landscape and reliability of LLMs.


### Open to Collaborations

I am always open to collaborations! If you have an interesting or early-stage idea， let’s discuss it and see how we can turn it into something impactful together.
