Hello everyone, and welcome to my personal bio!  

I completed my undergraduate studies at the **University of Michigan**, where I earned my **B.S. in Data Science** (Go Blue!).  
Currently, I am pursuing a **Master of Science in Data Science** at the **University of Chicago**, under the **Data Science Institute (DSI)**.  

During my time here, I have had the opportunity to work with incredible faculty and collaborators, including [**Prof. James Evans**](https://sociology.uchicago.edu/directory/James-A-Evans) at the [Knowledge Lab](https://knowledgelab.org/), [**Prof. Zhewei Sun**](https://zhewei-sun.github.io/) in the [Speech and Language Group](https://slattic.ttic.edu/) at the [Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago (TTIC)](https://www.ttic.edu/), [**Prof. Ari Holtzman**](https://ariholtzman.com/) at the [Conceptualization Lab](https://conceptualization.ai/), and [**Prof. Bryon Aragam**](https://bryonaragam.com/) at the [Booth School of Business](https://www.chicagobooth.edu/).
 

### Research Interests

I am interested in how we can build language systems that do more than map inputs to outputs, systems that actively participate in knowledge, reasoning, and interpretation. I view modern LLMs not just as predictors, but as emerging computational agents embedded in human information and social environments. My work explores how models can internalize structure, interrogate uncertainty, reflect on their own inferences, and surface latent patterns in human judgment and communication. Ultimately, I aim to design AI agentic language systems that are epistemically grounded and behaviorally aligned, systems that support scientific discovery, enhance human reasoning, advance agentic automation and expand our collective ability to generate and understand complex ideas.

### Open to Collaborations

I am always open to collaborations! If you have an interesting or early-stage， let’s discuss it and see how we can turn it into something impactful together.
